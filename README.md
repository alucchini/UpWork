# UpWork

This project is a school project that aims to use an ESP32 board, a fingerprint sensor, and an LCD screen to track the time of arrival and departure of employees. The system works by capturing the employee's fingerprint and sending the data to an MQTT broker. The broker then receives and processes the data to update the employee's attendance records.

## Requirements

 - ESP32 board
 - Fingerprint sensor
 - LCD screen
 - MQTT broker

## Usage

 1. Connect the ESP32 board, fingerprint sensor, and LCD screen as per the circuit diagram.
 2. Upload the code to the ESP32 board.
 3. Connect to the MQTT broker and start recording the attendance of employees by scanning their fingerprints.
 4. The attendance data can be monitored and managed from the MQTT broker.
